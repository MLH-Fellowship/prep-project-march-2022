# MLH Prep Project

Over the next 2 weeks, you'll be building a React App that works with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that talk to different data sources to do cool stuff.

We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. Your challenge over the next 2 weeks is to build out this website and add even more functionality to it. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out [Issues](/issues) for some more ideas!

You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the [website](https://reactjs.org) for some information on getting started!

## Contributing Guidelines

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

**IMPORTANT**
To commit the code, we have `commitlint` and `commitizen` configured in the project along with `husky` precommit hook.

To commit, simply run:

```
yarn commit
```

### Creating a Pull Request

- Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
  `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/storybook-addon` or `docs/component-api`. `type`
  can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
  commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

- Make and commit your changes following the commit conventions by using `yarn commit` command.

- Always `Squash and Merge` the PR after it is reviewed to the staging branch i.e. `develop` branch.

- Never merge your code or the PR directly to `main`
